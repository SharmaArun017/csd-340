        <h2>Chapter Title: My Journey</h2>
        <p class="intro">I grew up in a small town in Punjab,India. My childhood was filled with outdoor adventures, from playing basketball to going for morning runs. This instilled in me a deep love for nature and a sense of curiosity.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include reading, coding, and playing basketball and music. I spend most of my free time learning new things, whether it's a programming language or reading.</p>
        <p>I come from a close-knit family where we always support each other's endeavors. My parents encouraged me to pursue my passion for technology, which has led me to where I am today.</p>
        <p>I really enjoyed learning how to code in HTML. <span class="sentence">It was fun and exciting.</span> This started my interest in web development.</p>
